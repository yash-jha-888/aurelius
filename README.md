# Aurelius

Aurelius is a deep learning framework written in modern C++ from first principles.

I started this project to understand what happens underneath libraries like PyTorch instead of treating them as black boxes.

Every major building block is implemented manually, from the mathematics to the engineering, with the long-term goal of growing Aurelius into a complete deep learning framework.

One of the principles behind Aurelius is simple: every abstraction I use should be one I've implemented myself first.

Each major subsystem, including activations, weight initialization, loss functions, logging, and optimization, is designed as an independent abstraction that can be extended without modifying the rest of the framework.

## Architecture

Aurelius separates each major training component behind a common interface.

- Activation functions
- Weight initializers
- Optimizers
- Loss functions
- Layers

This design allows components to be replaced independently while keeping the training pipeline unchanged.

## Results

Current benchmark on MNIST:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|------:|
| Architecture | 784 → 128 → 64 → 10 |
| Optimizer | SGD |
| Activation | ReLU |
| Initializer | He |
| Test accuracy | 97.47% |
